# Coming Soon — SRD (Dark Mode)

A minimal, clean "Coming Soon" page designed for GitHub Pages.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. `srd-coming-soon`).
2. Upload **all files** from this folder to the repo root (or clone and push).
3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Choose **Branch: `main`** and **Folder: `/ (root)`**, then **Save**.
6. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` within a minute.

> Tip: The `.nojekyll` file is included to ensure assets serve correctly.
